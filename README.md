# Advent of Code 2018 (ANSI C90)

This repo contains solutions from the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018/) written in ANSI C90 using 
CMake. This is mostly just an exercise in trying to take existing solutions in C++ and translating them into C90 to acquaint myself more with the language. While I have used C99 and C11 a bit in the past, this is my first exposure to really trying to use ANSI C90. The solutions to all the answers will be printed out using standard 
output when running 'main.cpp'. I will also attempt to update or optimize solutions in the future should I think of it.
